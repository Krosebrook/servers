docker build -t mcp-webhooks .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env mcp-webhooks
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f webhook-server
```

### GitHub Container Registry

The webhook server is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry on every push to main:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/servers/webhook-server:latest
```

## GitHub Setup

### 1. Create Webhook

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to Webhooks
3. Click "Add webhook"
4. Set Payload URL to: `https://your-domain.com/webhook`
5. Set Content type to: `application/json`
6. Set Secret to your `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
7. Select events:
   - Issues
   - Pull requests
   - Pushes
   - Releases
   - Workflow runs
   - Repository

### 2. Generate Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with these scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)

## API Endpoints

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

The server includes health check endpoints for monitoring:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Logging

All events are logged with structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Processing pull_request event",
  "meta": {
    "repository": "modelcontextprotocol/servers",
    "prNumber": 123,
    "action": "opened"
  }
}
```

### Metrics

The webhook server tracks various metrics:
- Event processing times
- Success/failure rates
- Repository activity
- Contributor statistics

## Security

### Webhook Verification

All incoming webhooks are verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures to ensure they come from GitHub.

### Environment Security

- Secrets are loaded from environment variables
- No sensitive data in logs
- Secure Docker image with non-root user
- HTTPS required for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not receiving events**
   - Check GitHub webhook configuration
   - Verify webhook URL is accessible
   - Check webhook secret matches

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify GitHub token has correct permissions
   - Check token hasn't expired
   - Ensure token is properly set in environment

3. **Build failures**
   - Run `npm install` to update dependencies
   - Check TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`
   - Verify Node.js version (18+ required)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```
